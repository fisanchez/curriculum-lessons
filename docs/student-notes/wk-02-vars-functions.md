## Functions!

### 5 Parts of a function

**We will create a function called write that logs out "Hello I am writing!"**

1. The `function` keyword

```js
function
```

2. The name of your `function` (You can name it anything you want) - Don't forget your hugs! ()

```js
function write()
```

::: tip
functions are actions. Think of verbs when naming your functions
:::

3. parameter
  - One or more things your function expects to be given.

```js
function write(pencil)ssss
```

::: tip
Parameters are just variables. Remember with variables - think of them like nouns
:::

4. curly braces
  - Curly braces determine when the action starts and stops.The action goes in between. {}

```js
function write(pencil){
  // ACTION GOES IN HERE
}
```
